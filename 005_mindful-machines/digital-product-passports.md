
# Digital Product Passports (DPP)

## What?

Under the EU's Eco-Design for Sustainable Products Regulation (**ESPR**), Digital Product Passports will become mandatory - product by product - starting with batteries, textiles, and electronics.

Key data:
- ESPR has been in force since 18 July 2024.
- The first Working Plan for 2025 to 2030 was adopted on 16 April 2025.
- Digital Product Passport: mandatory wherever a product’s delegated act (Product Specific Rules) requires it, with the first rules expected from 2026.
- DPP Registry: the European Commission will launch a **central registry** by 19 July 2026. Economic operators will register product identifiers and receive a unique registration ID, and customs will use it to automatically verify that a DPP exists. A public portal will let stakeholders search and compare DPP data, subject to access rights.
- Horizontal measures planned, repairability including scoring in 2027, and recycled content and recyclability for electrical and electronic equipment in 2029.

## Motivation

The goal is to drive circularity and sustainability in the economy. Ecodesign is about whole-life impact.

## Blast radius

First rollout focuses on textiles, batteries, and electronics. It means that by 2027 all products from those categories sold in the EU will have to have a digital product passport. 

Cosmetics are expected to be included in Phase 2.

## What is a DPP?

It includes: 
* Product identification
* Performance information
* Substances of concern 
* Instructions for use, maintenance, and end-of-life treatment
* Sustainability information on recycled and renewable material content, and details on microplastic release
* Modularity and repairability
* Recyclability and circularity

# Knowledge graphs and data mesh as enablers for DPP

Introduction of DPP requires changes in organizational design and data management
* decentralization, data ownership: how do we make sure that data is FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability)?
* How do we define shared semantics across systems and enable data exchange (platforms, sectors, and countries; collaboration between actors like companies and regulators)?
* How do we add context to data so that it can be understand and meaningfully used by humans and machines?

1. Knowledge graph can naturally connect data;
2. data mesh (decentralized data architectures) is an enabler;
3. PLM industrial approach as organizational enabler**
