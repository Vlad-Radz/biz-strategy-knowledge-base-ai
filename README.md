## Context and motivation

This repository was created when everybody was thinking how to use AI in their organisations. The problem with AI models - especially with large language models (LLM) - is that they "hallucinate" as they lack true understanding of our world. So if you want that AI plays on your rules, you have to ground your world view a model. Keyword: business modeling, model-based systems engineering, enterprise architecture.

Luckily, specialists have been developing technologies and practices for modeling for decades. But materials about ontologies - way to express knowledge as an explicit, structured model - are often pretty hard to understand even for technical people. Thus I got the idea of developing a number of practice-oriented demos.

This repository presents multiple real-world scenarios for developing a knowledge base which can be used to enhance AI capabilities.

## What are ontologies

ðŸ“– If your are new to ontologies, you can read my article: "Teaching AI to understand our world: explaining ontologies like youâ€™re 5 years old" ([link](https://medium.com/ai-advances/teaching-ai-understand-our-world-explaining-ontologies-like-you-are-5-years-old-4e5653b5fcb1)), where I try to explain them as simple as possible, with some visuals. You can also check out another piece of me, "A Complaint from AI: 'I don\'t Understand Your Company'" ([link](https://medium.com/analysts-corner/a-complaint-from-ai-i-dont-understand-your-company-8314e39a2072)), where I explain the value of ontologies through the business lens.

## Viewing the world as a graph

A graph consists of nodes and relationships between them. Anything can be modeled as a graph. If you think about it, you see graphs everywhere, be it process diagrams or your navigator.
